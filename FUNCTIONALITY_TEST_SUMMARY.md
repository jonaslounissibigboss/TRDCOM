# WEBSITE FUNCTIONALITY TEST SUMMARY
**Date:** June 12, 2025
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED AND TESTED

## ðŸŽ¯ ISSUES ADDRESSED

### 1. Services Carousel Issues âœ… FIXED
- **Problem:** Clunky loading, moved only 1 card instead of 2, jumpy transitions
- **Solution:** Complete carousel logic rewrite with proper responsive behavior
- **Implementation:**
  - `getCardsToMove()`: Returns 2 cards on desktop (â‰¥768px), 1 on mobile
  - `navigateCarousel()`: Uses `cardsToMove` for proper movement
  - CSS transitions: `transform 0.6s cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94)`
  - Performance: Added `will-change: transform` for smooth animations
  - `isTransitioning` flag prevents overlapping animations

### 2. Hero Scroll Indicator âœ… FIXED
- **Problem:** Arrow down button in hero section not functional
- **Solution:** Added click event to scroll to about section
- **Implementation:**
  ```javascript
  heroScrollIndicator.addEventListener('click', () => {
      const aboutSection = document.getElementById('about');
      if (aboutSection) {
          aboutSection.scrollIntoView({ 
              behavior: 'smooth',
              block: 'start'
          });
      }
  });
  ```
- **Enhancements:** Added cursor pointer and hover effects

### 3. Back-to-Top Button âœ… FIXED
- **Problem:** Arrow up button in footer not functional
